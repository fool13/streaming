The latest from Force Thirteen US:
 ...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS EASTERN
   MS INTO MUCH OF AL AND WESTERN GA...
   ...SUMMARY...
   An outbreak of severe thunderstorms is likely through tonight, with
   the greatest threat expected across parts of Mississippi, Alabama
   and Georgia. Strong tornadoes, widespread damaging winds, and large
   hail are all possible.
   ...01Z Update...
   The main changes to the outlook this update were to remove much of
   OK/TX from severe probs. The exception being across far northeast TX
   where severe storms are currently ongoing. Probs have also been
   removed from all of IA and all but far southern MO/IL. The Moderate
   risk has been trimmed on the western edge behind the main line of
   storms across eastern MS. Further east, Slight and Enhanced
   probabilities have been expanded eastward from southern VA into
   central NC toward the SC/GA coasts and along the FL Panhandle. This
   is based on timing of the developing intense line/cluster of storms
   from eastern MS into northern GA, which will continue quickly
   spreading east/northeast overnight. 
-----------
   Intense cells are expected to continue shifting east/northeast
   tonight across AL/GA and into the Carolinas. Regional VWP data
   continues to show large, curved hodograph supportive of embedded
   supercell structures within the developing line/storm clusters. Even
   if eventual storm mode transitions to a more cohesive QLCS,
   mesovortex tornadoes are possible. Furthermore, 50+ kt
   south/southwesterly winds as low as 500-750 feet, indicating the
   intense low level jet, will support widespread damaging wind gusts
   into early Monday morning.
