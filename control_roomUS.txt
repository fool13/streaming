...Heavy snow and rain/freezing rain over parts of the Great Lakes into
parts of Northern Maine....
...There is an enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the
Central Gulf Coast and slight risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Lower/Middle Mississippi Valley into Western Ohio Valley and the Great
Lakes...
...Temperatures will be 10 to 35 degrees above average over the Eastern
Ohio Valley/Tennessee Valley into the Northeast...
...Heavy snow will continue over the higher elevations of the Northwest...
-------------------------
A potent winter storm will bring multiple weather hazards to much of the
Great Lakes/Middle Mississippi Valley and portions of the Northeast. 
Severe thunderstorms, heavy rain and flash flooding will impact a vast
portion of the Central Gulf Coast/Lower Mississippi Valley into the Great
Lakes.  Snow fall of up to one foot over parts of the Great Lakes downwind
from Lake Huron with six to eight inches over parts of Wisconsin off of
Lake Michigan.  A mix of rain, freezing rain, sleet and snow is expected
from the Middle Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes and into Northern
Maine.  Ice accumulations of 0.25 to 0.50 inches over Michigan and
Northern Maine.
--------------------------
Heavy rain in the range of 1 to 3+ inches is expected from the Tennessee
Valley northeastward to the Great Lakes.  Due to the slow progression of
this system, storm motion will be slow and expected to track over the
sames area.  This will become become problematic as soils become
saturated.  A slight risk of excessive rainfall is forecast over parts of
Tennessee Valley/Lower Mississippi Valley northeastward to the Western
Ohio Valley and parts of the Great Lakes.  The rain will produce scattered
flash flooding that will be mainly localized.  The most vulnerable area
will be urban areas, roads, and small streams with isolated significant
flash flooding possible.  Additionally, the Storm Prediction Center has
forecast a Enhanced Risk of severe weather for parts of the Central Gulf
Coast/Lower Mississippi Valley and Tennessee Valley.
---------------------------
A stark temperature gradient will setup over the country thanks to the
strong front over the eastern third of the country.  In the warm sector
ahead of the front, daily temperatures will average 10 to 35 degrees
warmer than typical early January readings.  Numerous records are expected
to be broken from the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys into the Northeast.      
---------------------------
The Pacific Northwest will have another low pressure system approach the
region on Sunday, which will amplify the precipitation.   Moderate to
heavy snow will continue over the Intermountain West and Northern/Central
Rockies through Monday.  Snow accumulations may very well reach or exceed
2 feet in the highest peaks of the Cascades, around 1 foot elsewhere.  
The snow levels will drop down to the coast on Sunday into Monday over
Washington and Oregon.
