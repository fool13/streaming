DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Florence was
located near latitude 32.8 North, longitude 74.7 West. Florence is
moving toward the northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h), and this general
motion, accompanied by a gradual decrease in forward speed, is
expected to continue through today.  A turn to the west-northwest
and west at an even slower forward speed is expected tonight and
Friday, and a slow west-southwestward motion is forecast Friday
night and Saturday.  On the forecast track, the center of Florence
will approach the coasts of North and South Carolina later today,
then move near or over the coast of southern North Carolina and
eastern South Carolina in the hurricane warning area tonight and
Friday. A slow motion over eastern South Carolina is forecast
Friday night through Saturday night.
Maximum sustained winds are near 110 mph (175 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is expected before the center
reaches the coast, with weakening expected after the center moves
inland.
Florence is a large hurricane.  Hurricane-force winds extend outward
up to 80 miles (130 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force
winds extend outward up to 195 miles (315 km). A NOAA buoy located
about 80 miles (130 km) south of the center of Florence has
recently reported sustained winds of 52 mph (83 km/h) with a gust
to 64 mph (104 km/h).
The estimated minimum central pressure is 956 mb (28.23 inches).
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water has the
potential to reach the following heights above ground if peak surge
occurs at the time of high tide...
Cape Fear NC to Cape Lookout NC, including the Neuse, Pamlico,
Pungo, and Bay Rivers...9-13 ft
North Myrtle Beach SC to Cape Fear NC...6-9 ft
Cape Lookout NC to Ocracoke Inlet NC...6-9 ft
South Santee River SC to North Myrtle Beach SC...4-6 ft
Ocracoke Inlet NC to Salvo NC...4-6 ft
Salvo NC to North Carolina/Virginia Border...2-4 ft
Edisto Beach SC to South Santee River SC...2-4 ft
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.
RAINFALL: Florence is expected to produce heavy and excessive
rainfall in the following areas...
Coastal North Carolina into far northeastern South Carolina...20 to
30 inches, isolated 40 inches. This rainfall would produce
catastrophic flash flooding and prolonged significant river
flooding.
Rest of South and North Carolina into southwest Virginia...6 to 12
inches, isolated 24 inches.
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast within
the hurricane warning area this evening or early Friday.  Winds are
expected to first reach tropical storm strength by later this
morning or early this afternoon, making outside preparations
difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life and property
should be nearing completion.
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible in eastern North Carolina
through Friday.
SURF:  Swells generated by Florence are affecting Bermuda, portions
of the U.S. East Coast, and the northwestern and central Bahamas.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
