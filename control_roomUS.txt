 Day 1 Convective Outlook  
 NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
 0642 AM CST Sat Jan 11 2020
 Valid 111300Z - 121200Z
   ...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS PARTS OF THE
   SOUTHEAST STATES...
---------
   ...SUMMARY...
   Scattered to potentially widespread damaging winds are expected
   across parts of the Southeast States through at least this evening.
   The greatest threat for tornadoes will be across eastern Mississippi
   and Alabama, mainly midday to afternoon.
---------
   ...Southeast...
   Primary change this outlook is to add a 10 sig tornado probability
   across AL where the potential for at least a couple strong tornadoes
   is evident this afternoon, and increase damaging wind probabilities
   to 45 percent.
   An extensive squall line is ongoing from western KY into the
   northwest Gulf. While the northern portion of the line has recently
   outpaced surface-based instability, 850-700 mb winds above 75 kt
   will continue to support bowing/LEWP structures along with embedded
   tornadoes across from TN to LA this morning where 65-70 F surface
   dew points are prevalent. 
   As the powerful southern Great Plains shortwave trough ejects more
   northeastward today, attendant large-scale forcing for ascent will
   begin to wane across the southern portion of the QLCS. There are
   some CAMs that suggest the line may break up slightly this afternoon
   as it progresses into AL. This could result in more favorable
   embedded supercell potential as low-level hodographs will remain
   quite enlarged. With the northern periphery of upper 60s surface dew
   points expected to translate east ahead of the line into central and
   southern AL, a couple strong tornadoes are possible. 
   By evening into tonight, increasing separation between the stronger
   forcing for ascent and outpacing of the remnant QLCS/convective line
   from greater than meager surface-based instability should yield an
   increasingly marginal damaging wind and tornado threat into the
   Carolinas and VA.
