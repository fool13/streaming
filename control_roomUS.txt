...Severe thunderstorms, heavy rain, flooding, accumulating ice and heavy
snow expected across the central and eastern states today and into the
weekend....
..Temperatures will be 10 to 25 degrees above average over the Southern
Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley into the Ohio Valley/Great Lakes...
...Heavy snow once again possible in higher elevations of the Northwest...
A potent winter storm will bring a plethora for types of weather hazards
to much of the central U.S. and portions of the Northeast. Severe
thunderstorms, heavy rain and flash flooding will impact a vast portion of
south-central states. Numerous flood warnings and flash flood watches are
in effect from northeast Texas to western New York. A mix of rain,
freezing rain, sleet and snow is expected from the Central Plains to the
Great Lakes region. Winter storm warnings, winter weather advisories and
winter storm watches are in effect from northern Texas to Maine.
Heavy rain in the range of 1 to 3+ inches is expected from the Southern
Plains northeastward to the Great Lakes.  Due to the slow progression of
this system, storm motion will be slow and expected to track over the
sames area.  This will become become problematic as soils become
saturated. A moderate risk of excessive rainfall is forecast over parts of
Eastern Oklahoma and neighboring states.  The rain will produce numerous
flash flooding will occur with many streams being flooded and floods
affecting larger rivers. Additionally, the Storm Prediction Center has
forecast a Moderate Risk of severe weather for parts of the Southern
Plains to Lower Mississippi Valley.
Light to moderate snow over the Intermountain West and Rockies will spread
eastward. A wintry mix of snow, sleet, and rain/freezing rain is possible
in portions of the Southern/Central Plains into the Middle Mississippi
Valley and northeastward into the Great Lakes Friday into Sunday as
temperatures fall. The heaviest rain/freezing rain is forecast over parts
of Great Lakes Saturday into Sunday.
A stark temperature gradient will setup over the country thanks to the
strong front over the Central U.S. into the Great Lakes.  In the warm
sector ahead of the front, daily temperatures will average 10 to 25
degrees warmer than typical early January readings. Numerous records are
expected to be broken from the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys into the
Northeast.  In contrast, the western half of the country will be much
colder than usual as a cold front and secondary cold front reinforces the
frigid airmass.  On Friday, high temperatures in the single digits are
forecast for the north-central tier of the nation.     
The Pacific Northwest will have another low pressure system approach the
region on Friday, which will amplify the precipitation.  Coastal areas
will have periods of moderate rain while higher elevations of the
Cascades, Northern Great Basin and the Northern Rockies will have heavy
snow.  Snow accumulations may very well reach or exceed 2 feet in the
highest peaks of the Cascades, around 1 foot elsewhere.
