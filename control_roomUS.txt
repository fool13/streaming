THE LATEST FROM FORCE THIRTEEN US:
...Dangerous winter storm bringing heavy snow and powerful winds
into early Friday...
------------------------------------
A strong, dangerous winter storm will continue to impact
interior Northern California through early Friday morning.
Strong winds and heavy snowfall will create whiteout conditions
with extremely limited visibility over the Northern Sierra,
especially tonight through tomorrow. Additional significant snow
amounts are forecast in the northern Sierra and southern Cascades
through early Friday. Strong winds and heavy snow may also cause
downed trees, tree limbs, and power outages. Travel will be
extremely difficult to impossible at times. Travel is not advised.
If you risk travel, especially over the Sierra, be prepared for
lengthly road closures, chain controls, and near zero
visibilities. Bring enough food, water, and warm clothes to last
lengthy closures.
