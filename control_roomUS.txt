The latest from Force Thirteen NOLA:
Tropical Weather Discussion for North America, Central America
Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, northern sections of South
America, and Atlantic Ocean to the African coast from the
Equator to 32N. The following information is based on satellite
imagery, weather observations, radar and meteorological analysis.

Based on 1800 UTC surface analysis and satellite imagery through 
2319 UTC.

...MONSOON TROUGH/ITCZ...

The monsoon trough extends from Sierra Leone near 07N13W to near 
03N18W. The ITCZ continues from 03N18W to 04S31W to the coast of 
Brazil near 02S44W. Scattered to numerous moderate with embedded 
isolated strong convection is along the ITCZ from 01S-06S between
19W-36W. Scattered moderate convection is also seen along the
monsoon trough from 04N-01S between 18W-08W.

GULF OF MEXICO...

A digging mid-upper level trough is causing upper level 
diffluence and divergence across the NW Gulf of Mexico ahead of a 
low pressure system bringing a strong cold front across the 
southern Plains. This is causing scattered showers across most of 
the Gulf with the exception of the southern portion of the basin. 
At the surface, a 1019 mb high located in the western Atlantic is 
causing ridging across the eastern Gulf. Ahead of the low pressure
system in the southern Plains, moderate to fresh southeasterly 
winds are seen in the western basin with light to gentle east- 
southerly winds are in the eastern Gulf.
